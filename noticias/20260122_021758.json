    "noticia": "Recent data shows that new bitcoin whales have surpassed the traditional group of long-term holders in terms of controlled value, resulting in a $6 billion supply overhang. This imbalance is expected to contribute to continued price volatility. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, these new whales have accumulated significant amounts of bitcoins since late 2022, while older holders are holding steady or even selling some of their holdings. As the market tries to find equilibrium, this supply and demand mismatch could lead to wild swings in prices.",
